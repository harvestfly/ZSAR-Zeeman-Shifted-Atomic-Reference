High magnetic field atomic spectroscopy (up to 1 Tesla)
=======================================================

** FILES WILL BE UPLOADED SOON **

Design of a custom permanent magnet pair and their holder that
allows application of the magnetic fields of up to 1 T
in the gap between the magnets.
Central bore in the magnets allows laser beam access for laser spectroscopy
of atomic vapour contained in a spectroscopic cell placed between the magnets.
A distance between the magnets can be adjusted, continuously adjusting magnetic
field.

This is a part of the setup used for providing frequency reference for laser
locking for atomic physics experiments. As a part of optical setup for
Zeeman Shifted Atomic Reference (ZSAR), it can provide locking signal for lasers
up to ~19 GHz away from the unperturbed D transitions in Rubidium atoms.
Signal is generated from sub-Doppler spectroscopy of atomic transitions,
has low drift siutable for atomic physics experiments, and can be controllably
tuned in wide range of frequencies. For more details see reference below.
